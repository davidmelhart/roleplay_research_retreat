					<h3>Goals</h3>
					
					<p>The Roleplay Research Retreat (R3) is a research-based event exploring how games and their mechanics can contribute to facets of collaborative storytelling, emergent narrative and the mythos/historical events that emerge within the player group. This retreat aims to address the gap between research and practice, looking at the ways in which academics can apply their tools to the discussion, development (e.g. via asset creation), and evaluation of role-playing games. This includes but is not limited to tabletop RPGs, technology-enhanced RPGs, boardgame renditions of RPGs, and storygames.</p>

					<p>The Roleplay Research Retreat follows successful academic retreats such as <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/dagstuhl-seminars" target="_blank">Dagstuhl</a> and <a href="https://shonan.nii.ac.jp/seminars/" target="_blank">Shonan</a>, where an intense period of collaboration is interspersed with social events and networking. In R3 in particular, however, the number of participants is limited in order to enable more applied research by testing different RPG systems and approaches in-between theoretical discussions during the days of the retreat. The outcome is expected to be a number of reports and publications along these directions.</p>

					<h3>Organizers</h3>

					<p><strong>Phil Lopes</strong> is an Assistant Professor at Lusófona University, his focus lies at the crossroads of Digital Game AI, Affective Computing, Human Computer Interfaces, Virtual Cinematic Productions and Game Design. He has published in fields such as affective computing, procedural content generation and game artificial intelligence. More recently, his research has shifted towards exploring the influence of collaborative storytelling and its influence on player experience and creativity, for the construction of transdisciplinary systems capable of leveraging collaborative creativity using playful game mechanics for fields beyond entertainment.</p>

					<p><strong>David Melhart</strong> is a Postdoctoral AI Researcher at the Institute of Digital Games, University of Malta. His research focuses on User Research, Player Modelling, Annotation Tools for Affective Computing, and Ethics in Game AI. He was a keynote speaker and panellist at the 26th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2023 - Ethics of Game AI Workshop EGAI @ ECAI 2023, Communication Chair of FDG 2020, Workshop and Panels Chair of FDG2023, has been a recurring Organizer and Publicity Chair of the Summer School series on Artificial Intelligence and Games (2018-2024), and currently serves as an Editorial Assistant to the IEEE Transactions on Games. His interests in RPG research are focused on Player Experience Research, and Game Design.</p>

					<p><strong>Antonios Liapis</strong> is an Associate Professor at the Institute of Digital Games, University of Malta, where he bridges the gap between game technology and game design in courses focusing on human-computer creativity, digital prototyping and game development. His research focuses on Artificial Intelligence as an autonomous creator or as a facilitator of human creativity. His work includes computationally intelligent tools for game design, as well as computational creators that blend semantics, visuals, sound, plot and level structure to create horror games, adventure games and more. He has also co-organized numerous game jams, and has participated in even more!</p>

					<h3>Venue</h3>
					<p>The second event of the R3 is taking place in the Portugese hinterlands around the city of Leiria on 28 June - 4 July 2025. The event is organized by the <a href="https://www.ulusofona.pt/en/" target="_blank">Lusófona University</a> and <a href="http://um.edu.mt/" target="_blank">University of Malta</a>. The city of Leiria is a charming blend of medieval heritage and vibrant modern life. Highlights include the imposing Leiria Castle overlooking the city, the picturesque old town with its winding streets and traditional houses, and the stunning beaches of São Pedro de Moel and Vieira de Leiria, perfect for a seaside escape.
