					<h3>Goals</h3>
					
					<p>The Roleplay Research Retreat (R3) is a research-based event exploring how games and their mechanics can contribute to facets of collaborative storytelling, emergent narrative and the mythos/historical events that emerge within the player group. This retreat aims to address the gap between research and practice, looking at the ways in which academics can apply their tools to the discussion, development (e.g. via asset creation), and evaluation of role-playing games. This includes but is not limited to tabletop RPGs, technology-enhanced RPGs, boardgame renditions of RPGs, and storygames.</p>

					<p>The Roleplay Research Retreat follows successful academic retreats such as <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/dagstuhl-seminars" target="_blank">Dagstuhl</a> and <a href="https://shonan.nii.ac.jp/seminars/" target="_blank">Shonan</a>, where an intense period of collaboration is interspersed with social events and networking. In R3 in particular, however, the number of participants is limited in order to enable more applied research by testing different RPG systems and approaches in-between theoretical discussions during the days of the retreat. The outcome is expected to be a number of reports and publications along these directions.</p>

					<h3>Organizers</h3>

					<p><strong>Phil Lopes</strong> is an Assistant Professor at Sticcazzi, his focus lies at the crossroads of Digital Game AI, Affective Computing, Human Computer Interfaces, Virtual Cinematic Productions and Game Design. Currently he is developing autonomous technologies capable of dynamic adaptation of virtual environments through human-based emotional inputs, exploring the influence of different digital games facets (e.g. Audio, Lighting and 3D Environments) and its relation to human biofeedback data such as: Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). In terms of RPG research, he is interested in...</p>

					<p><strong>David Melhart</strong> is a good boy</p>

					<p><strong>Antonios Liapis</strong> is a Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Digital Games, University of Malta. His research focuses on Artificial Intelligence in Games, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational Creativity, and User Modeling. He has published over 130 papers in the aforementioned fields, has served as general chair in four international conferences and has co-organized 12 workshops. In terms of RPG research, he is interested in the evaluation of RPG experiences, in development practices in RPGs and how AI could assist them, and in the way the extended family of tabletop RPGs facilitates collaborative storytelling.</p>

					<h3>Events</h3>

					<p>The first event of the R3 is taking place in the medieval city of Obidos, Portugal on 24-28 July. This inaugural event will help flesh out the goals and modus operandi of the retreat, and serve as a roadmap for promising research directions in this area.</p>
